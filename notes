NOTE: To Make Bootstrap more responsive on Mobile Devices
    Note about making bootstrap responsive on mobile devices
    Section 7, Lecture 87

    If you want your bootstrap styled website to be responsive on mobile then be sure to add the following meta tag to your <head>  element, above the <title>  tag:

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    As a side note, if you can't get the <hr> element to appear correctly on mobile devices then see here for a fix.
